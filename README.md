Hey, I'm Rasmus – A game developer and low-level graphics programmer based in Sweden.🔥

What I do most days 🧠:
- 🎮 Game Engine Development (C/C++, DirectX, OpenGL)
- 🎨 Real-time Rendering & Graphics Programming
- 🧱 Procedural Generation, Tool development, and debugging

Tools & Languages 🛠️:
C/C++, Java, Python, GLSL, HLSL, DirectX, OpenGL, JavaScript/TypeScript, Svelte, Git
(But also: C#, Lua, SQL, CUDA, Vulkan, React, Vue, Godot)

Probably working on some low-level library no one asked for, reinventing the wheel but with better memory alignment.😎
